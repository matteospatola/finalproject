Twitter Account: @StormPY_weather



First created twitter developer account to access api keys and access tokens

Created functions that authenticates api keys and tokens and tweets when programs run 

Next utilized openweathermap api to retrieve weather data and converted data into json format to easily access elements of dictionary

Assigned desired weather metrics to variables, using the weather metric variables created function that returns formatted string (weather report)

Main Function utilizes tweet function where I pass the api authentication function and weather report function as arguments
